We attended the IEEE VR online conference.
And summarized some experiences.

Generally amazing choice to enable various tools for online participation in a conference with around 1600 participants.

## Tools used
* Slack for communication https://ieeevr-slack-invite.glitch.me/
* hubs for virtual meeting rooms https://hubs.mozilla.com/#/
* Twitch for live-streaming of talks https://www.twitch.tv/ieeevr2020_great_room_1
![Twitch stream after sessions](https://i.imgur.com/30kA2Ln.jpg)
* Zoom to get presenters into video, when they were not presenting in Hubs (VR in VR presentations), and really lots of them, e.g. picture of student volunteers when thanking them during closing ceremony

* sli.do for asking questions during talks, which were presented besides the talk screens in Hubs and on Twitch, with possibility to enter names etc. https://www.sli.do/ (event code #IEEEVR2020). ENtries were deleted after each talk, so no permanent record visible, which made this appropriate for some direct interaction
* Birds of Feathers ([BoF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing))) events in specific Hubs rooms, e.g. participated in VR Europe Meetup

## Experience:
* Quite complex at first to interact with the variety of tools, but ok at some point
* Usability of hubs quite complex IMO since login via email required and often necessary again. Could be usage error at my end.
* Quality of posters in Hubs very poor, both when viewing with HMD (e.g. some HMD-user visitors of our SiSiMo poster reported they could not read quite high-res text) and when using PC screens
* Video quality very strongly network dependent on Twitch, as expected, and in Corona Times sometimes even with fixed network connection at 60 Mbps download, 25 Mbps upload speed quite poor. Especially when people were presenting in Hubs, on Twitch the readability of the text was sometimes poor, especially when the talkers were rather far away from their presentation screen in their virtual room
* Many times audio was the issue - when stalling occurred, not directly visible, but audible, sometimes just audio outages. Was main issue in QoE, interestingly, beyond the access issues / usability problems in Hubs!
* Nonetheless, quite cool experience to present(!) the poster in Hubs, since it was possible to chat and talk with the visitors (only about 6 in total I think).
    * Poster time was too short, 2 sessions of 30 min for each poster, and considering that there were around 64 posters during these 60 min, naturally with the Hubs usability issues the number of visitors was very low. Also the sheer access hurdle made the visitor-rate rather low during the first days, seems to have been quite a bit improved during days 3 and 4.
    * Certainly better usage of the advertisement function via Slack would have helped to attrack viewers. Doing that or not is a matter of own attitude to that I guess...
* In spite of all issues, the knowledge that this was enabled via a platform that usually is made for rather small groups and small spaces and which has been extended particularly for this purpose by the Goergia and other places' Mozilla folks, and with the appreciation of some exchange and company in spite of the self-isolation times, it clearly was a spectacular experience
    * Expectations have completely modified any negative impressions and have lead to an ultimately very positive memory of the event: Cf. Kahneman as well, retrospective judgment of episodes, and in this context especially the utility that clearly has been related to the event, the significance, the value, intrinsically creating a contribution to Quality of Life (QoL).
* Generally amazing event, and will for sure stick in evceryone's memory, a huge playground with fun and playful interactions - although buggy and imperfect - that was very daring and remarkably enabling to preserve a community, using of course the tools of that commity in an excellent manner!
