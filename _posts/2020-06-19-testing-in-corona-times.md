We had to run a subjective test while there were still some corona-related restrictions.
That's why we wanted to be extra cautious.

## Intro
With the still ongoing corona virus crisis a lot of workers from very different areas face troubles and inconveniences. <!--- While every single one counts, some are hit harder than others and have to deal with working from home, working short-time or even losing their jobs while managing their kids who can't go to school and living life in a very unusual and troubling way. -->
Us, working at a university or in science generally, are less affected by existence-threatening work-related issues in contrast to health, tourist, and gastronomy workers, since working from home is very much possible in these days, especially if most of the work is done using a computer while being connected to our coworkers via internet.
Even in the phase of the most severe COVID19-induced restrictions my working habits hardly changed from the usual way but this need not necessarily apply to everyone.
However, being part of the QoE community and therefore measuring the experience and quality of media, we heavily rely on user ratings to work with because measuring, understanding, and modelling the human perception of media of all kind and form can only be done asking real people for their judgments.
These judgments or ratings are gathered in so-called subjective tests in normal times. These subjective tests are conducted in a lab which acts as a controlled environment with stable and standardized conditions as well as methodologies.
Although some other labs as well as us have been doing so-called crowdsourcing tests for quite some time, there are still limitations and problems due to the nature of a test that is done in peoples' homes.
On the one hand, you can not control (and therefore they differ and potentially change very much) any of the surrounding conditions in vivo and, this is even worse, on the other hand the subjects at home do not even necessarily have the required technical equipment to playout, watch, and ultimately rate the media elements that are studied.
This is especially true when conducting experiments with future or very current technology such as 4K, 8K, HDR, HFR, VR, AR, HMDs, 3D audio, HQ audio, or comparing specific devices.
This is especially bad since most of the actual science of today in QoE is being done in these explorative areas.

## Goals
So, how to continue working in the area of QoE with respect to handling the Corona pandemic in a responsible and safe manner?
There are three obvious answers to this:
- Use already collected data and and analyze more extensively.
- Go (classic, internet-based) crowdsourcing.
- Create a hygiene concept under which lab studies are possible.

If, due to mentioned or other reasons, the first two options are not possible for you, you face the same problem we did. Since we wanted to keep the infection risk for our participants and supervisors as low as possible, we even raised the bar in comparison to university or governmental rules when it comes to hygiene measures.
We had the following goals:
1. At no given moment of the test the supervisor and subject should be in physical contact or closer than 1.5m. We also don't want them to be in the same room for more than a minute.
2. The lab should be well ventilated to avoid aerosols from staying in the air at high concentration.
3. The elements being touched by subjects are either to be used just once or thoroughly to be cleaned after each and every participant.
4. Despite the strict measures the test procedure should be as normal and pleasant as possible to not introduce unwanted and uncontrollable biases.

## Testing
Since one of our research activities includes the evaluation of music on different loudspeakers, the test needed to be done in the lab. Luckily, the institute's audio lab (see [https://www.tu-ilmenau.de/en/institute-for-media-technology/the-institute/equipment/audio-lab/](Audio Lab webpage)) has a lot of preconditions that eased our life a lot.
Since it is built to enable to record and to quietly listen to audio pieces, there are two separate rooms that are connected with a large-scale window: the operator's room and the actual hearing room.
With a talkback system that enabled us to speak directly with the subject (two good microphones and two speakers, volume controllable, muting possible) the supervisor and the subject were able to speak with and look at each other in a very natural way although being separated a glass window of 3cm.
You can see a view from the operator's room into the hearing room in the picture below.
To address the second goal we regulated the lab's air conditioning system to pump the highest amount of air possible into and out of the room while still being perceptively unhearable.
Additionally, between every two tests we opened an outside door to enable even more air exchange.

There was also around 30 minutes of time between two different subjective test runs, while we tried to keep the overall test duration below 45 minutes.

Naturally, every test starts with the arrival of the subject.
Every unneeded door was kept open to avoid having to touch it.
Still, for the arrival we made it obligatory to wear a mask that covered both nose and mouth.
We immediately directed the subject into the hearing room and instructed him or her to sit at the illuminated test chair without further ado.
Then the supervisor closed the door behind the subject and sat himself into the operator's room to welcome the participant using the talkback system.
We explained that this user test will be a bit different than usual and that they can take off their mask to avoid discomfort caused by it.
Then normally the subject would read and fill out the instructions and legal papers and would be led through the training part by the supervisor.
We chose to do this as digital as possible.
We used a Microsoft Surface Pro 6 tablet to access a laptop located in the operator's room using Windows Remote Desktop.
This enabled the supervisor to access the test software at any given time in case of an error.
We decided on using a tablet (instead of e.g. mouse and keyboard or paper sheets) since we concluded that it was easiest to disinfect using wipes not damaging the display and most efficient in terms of test analysis.

Although the test was built to be self-descriptive, subjects were allowed to ask any question during the training part which were immediately answered by the supervisor.
After the training, and to avoid the sense of being watched, the subjects were allowed to close a curtain that blocked the windows, but it was hardly employed.
After the test was done, the subjects told the instructor about their success and were told to re-apply the mask.
The instructor then opened the door of the hearing room and the subject could leave the facilities.
As already mentioned, our measures included the reduction of interactions with doors etc. as well as the implementation of effective disinfection concepts.
Therefore, we cleaned all areas touched by the subjects (tablet, chair, table) with a wipe disinfectant and also used a new pen for every participant.

## Findings
One thing we haven't talked about is recruiting subjects.
Since our usual participants are students, we faced different problems: Ilmenau is a small city and the university doesn't have so many registered students.
Therefore the overall number of potential candidates is already quite low.
Additionally, it seemed as if many students were not even in Ilmenau since all the teaching is currently performed online which further reduced the amount of potential subjects.
At last, the ones being in Ilmenau were more reluctant in signing up for the test.
Summarizing, we had the impression, that, although we were able to pay the usual expense allowance, it was way harder to recruit participants.

Besides this, all subjects respected and welcomed our measures and reported that the artificial talkback system neither hindered them from getting needed information nor introduced any issues.
After having had more than 60 participants we can conclude that the disinfectant didn't affect the display of the tablet.

The additional time overhead prolonged the overall testing duration by a factor of 50 percent.
Usually we can get the ratings of around 30 participants in a test that takes about an hour per subject in one week's time (5 working days of 8h).
This time we needed around 7.5 working days to reach this amount of ratings.

The results of the test do not show any obvious case of problems that can be connected to the additional pandemic-related measures we applied.
The additional costs to enforce the hygienic concept were less than 80â‚¬.

To sum this up (TLDR:): lab-centered subjective testing is still possible in a reasonable manner in these days as long the university is open for personnal and students, the lab has some specific prerequisites and hygiene-related concepts are getting enforced.
