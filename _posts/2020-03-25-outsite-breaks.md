Team work during COVID-19 times seems to be more challenging.

We usually do during the work day some outside breaks, drinking coffee and exchanging the daily work problems and related topics.
In times of corona, especially considering that we all are now in home office, such breaks are hard or not existing.
However, we think that it is a general helping tool for our work, thus we hosted a [mumble server](https://www.mumble.info/), that is a sytem usually used for gamers to communicate.
Our mumble server cannot replace a real interaction but just for some chatting it is ok.
Why did we selected mumble instead of jisti or similar, more or less just because it can be used with a super low bandwidth (8Kbit/s).
Team communication and a shared spirit is still an important part of the daily work life.
